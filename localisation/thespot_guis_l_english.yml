 tips_and_tricks_main_text:0 "Templates depend on your doctrine so this will be categorised by doctrine Mobile Warfare left-right Infantry: Pure 20w's depending on your strategy anti air may be incorporated into these divisions to shred enemy CAS Tanks: 40w 7-8motorised depending on situations and the rest can be tanks. But remember to research Anti Air and Anti Tank variants as they allow you to fight under unfavourable air conditions and break heavily armoured tanks with ease. For the variants you would remove 1 Medium tank and replace it with 2 SPAA and do the same with TD's but only a 1 for 1 replacement Alternative tank variant for Vanilla or infantry breaking tanks: 4 SPG's 6-7 tanks and 7-8 motorised again depending on situations Superior Firepower Infantry: Build both 14/4's (14 infantry 4 arty) with support companies to the max usually engineer, arty, recon, signals, and the last slot is reserved for their specialisation. You can get anti-tank for a dday division, rocket arty for a naval invading division, or logistics for something that will be in a low supply zone. The most important companies are engineer, signals, and recon. Then you can have 20w's with support engineers and arty potentially but engineers should be just fine or pure 20w's Tanks: Tanks are still viable in Superior firepower although a lot weaker than mobile warfare. Their method is low or massive soft attack. There are two commonly used templates 1. 12 Mediums 8 Motorised (Again you can take out tanks and replace them with variants for specialisation) The tank template must have 5 support companies otherwise this will not be as effective. \n \n The way encryption vs decryption works is per level of decryption you have above an enemies encryption you get 5% extra boost to all stats in a battle. The base level is 0 encryption at the start of the game. Encryption: Is a defensive research and helps protect against the enemy's decryption level battle advantage If you have level 2 and your enemy has level 2 decryption your divisions are still hidden If you have level 3 and your enemy has level 3 decryption your divisions are mostly hidden varying with terrain and weather. Decryption: If your stat is high enough you get a boost to all base stats by 5% per level of decryption you have higher over enemy encryption. Volunteers Your divisions have the cryptology level of the country you sent your divisions as volunteers too. Faction Based Entering a battle with allies averages out the decryption and encryption of all parties involved. THEREFORE, if you join a battle with less encryption you make your allies divisions worse in that battle. \n \n Fighters: Should always upgraded in this order: Engine -> Range -> Weapons. Reliability is completely useless."
