 thespot.sov.1.t: "Imminent Collapse"
 thespot.sov.1.d: "The German Reich have taken an unprecedented amount of territory within our dear Motherland, and show no signs of stopping. Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Yaroslavl--They are all in Hitler's hands. Without these vital logistical centers, the Red Army is crippled and struggling to continue fighting, especially given the defeatism now common amongst the ranks. Word has it that Joseph Stalin was last seen boarding a railway carriage headed east..."
 thespotmod.soviet.1.a: "Is this the end of our Union?"
 thespot.sov.2.t: "The Fall of Minsk"
