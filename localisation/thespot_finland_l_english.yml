 finland.spot8.t:0 "Finland Offers Concessions"
 finland.spot8.d:0 "The war with Finland has been a costly affair, but as we have been able to push back their army they have presented us with a compelling offer. We are given control of strategically important areas, but need to withdraw our troops and cease further hostilities.\n\nThis will end our offensive on Finland without full control over the region, but will in turn allow us to focus on extending our sphere of influece in other parts of the world."
 finland.spot8.a:0 "Our soldiers are needed elsewhere"
 fin_offer_peace:0 "Offer Peace to the Soviet Union"
 fin_offer_peace_desc:0 "We're losing, and our men are in danger! It's time to settle a peace before it's too late."
 FIN_hold_karelia:0 "Hold Karjala"
 FIN_hold_karelia_desc:0 "The Soviet Union marches on our land! We must mobilize every available reserve to the Mannerheim Line to defend Helsinki from the red menace. If we can hold Karjala long enough, not only will the Soviets surely think twice about continuing the war, we will be able to evacuate a sizable portion of our industry!"
 fin_situational_awareness:0 "Njet, Molotoff!"
 fin_situational_awareness_desc:0 "To the east, the bear slumbers. Russia has always seen Finland as a natural part of its sphere, and there's little reason to doubt the Communists see us as a target when the time is right. Whether or not any choose to help us, we stand proud and tall against Stalin's tyranny."
 fin_naval_effort:0 "Naval Effort"
 fin_naval_effort_desc:0 "The Finnish fleet has never been strong, and is mostly a coastal patrol fleet. We could make it a bit better."
 fin_baltic_fleet:0 "The Merivoimat"
 fin_baltic_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy needs a proper doctrine, and convoy raiding seems like the most reasonable choice, given our size. If nothing else, we're certain to annoy our enemies."
 fin_expand_baltic_fleet:0 "Expand the Baltic Fleet"
 fin_expand_baltic_fleet_desc:0 "The Väinämöinen Class of Cruisers is the most notable ship we have right now, and calling it fit for war would be a lie. We need to improve on this design and come up with something that can compete with the rest of the world."
 fin_aviation_effort:0 "Finland in the Air"
 fin_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The vastness of Finland means that it will be difficult for our enemies to maintain an effective air presence. While we will never match them in numbers, local superiority doesn't sound like a pipe dream... Assuming we can get some planes."
 fin_license_German_fighters:0 "License German Fighters"
 fin_license_German_fighters_desc:0 "German air designs are massively superior, and their government is at least somewhat friendly to us. Perhaps they'd be willing to sell us some designs?"
 fin_license_German_CAS:0 "License German CAS"
 fin_license_German_CAS_desc:0 "Aircraft is only useful to the extent it can make a difference on the battlefield, and thusly we must focus on close air support."
 fin_aviation_effort_2:0 "Construct Additional Airfields"
 fin_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Creating some more airfields would be useful for both military and commercial purposes. While our airfields are more than sufficient for what we have, they will prove to be shabby for housing the airforce of an ally."
 fin_rocket_effort:0 "Rocketry Innovations"
 fin_rocket_effort_desc:0 "Work with our airforce and perhaps some tips from a friend or two have provided insights into the secrets of rocketry. We must make good use of this!"

 fin_militarism:0 "Militarism"
 fin_militarism_desc:0 "Our new policy must be one of mass mobilization of our people. Every available man and perhaps even child, along with a few women, must know how to use a rifle; the independence of Finland depends on it.
 fin_democracy:0 "Finnish Freedom"
 fin_democracy_desc:0 "We did not free ourselves from the Russian Empire 20 years ago only to fall back into the clutches of tyranny. The people of Finland love their freedom, and shall remain free.

 fin_armed_and_ready_desc:0 "Should any enemy ever invade Finland, they will find a nation more than ready for them."

 fin_whiteguard:0 "The White Guard"
 fin_whiteguard_desc:0 "The White Guard was a home defense militia formed during the Finnish Civil War. Over the course of the 1920s and 30s, much of the White Guard was formally incorporated into the Finnish Defense Forces, becoming an important source of recruits during the Winter War and Continuation War."
 fin_mannerheim_line:0 "The Mannerheim Line"
 fin_mannerheim_line_desc:0 "The Mannerheim line was a series of trenches and small bunkers in Karjala, designed to make passage by enemy troops difficult and costly while buying time for further mobilization.

 fin_continuation_war:0 "The Continuation War"
 fin_continuation_war_desc:0 "The Soviet Union did not respect our independence, and they still do not. They stole our land, and soon will be back for more. Hitler's invasion provides a great opportunity to reclaim what is ours, and perhaps a bit more..."
 fin_greater_dream:0 "Greater Finland"
 fin_greater_dream_desc:0 "The three isthmus border is obviously the natural border of Finland. Neither Sweden nor Russia has historically respected our rightful claims; Germany shall, once this war is finished."
 fin_expand_Pieksamaki:0 "Expand Pieksämäki"
 fin_expand_Pieksamaki_desc:0 "The Pieksämäki railway in Savo is an important logistical hub for civilian amd military goods. Improving this vital railway is a natural first step as we look at the rest of our economy."

 fin_industrialize_Helsinki:0 "Industrialize Helsinki"
 fin_industrialize_Helsinki_desc:0 "Now that the roots of our economy have been assisted, we can look to establishing more heavy industry. Helsinki, our capital, is a natural place to encourage the production of machine tools, steel, and some other limited ventures."
 fin_Swedish_arms:0 "Swedish Arms"
 fin_Swedish_arms_desc:0 "Sweden, our neighbor, may be neutral. However, they seem to have no qualms about selling weapons. Given our limited industry, it seems wise to purchase some of our guns from them."
 fin_German_arms:0 "German Arms"
 fin_German_arms_desc:0 "Germany is a bit distant, but has a good amount of war material to spare. Reaching out to them could be the beginning of a profitable relationship, assuming we can avoid becoming too intwined with them."
 fin_national_armory:0 "National Armory"
 fin_national_armory_desc:0 "Establishing a national armory in Helsinki will be a source of great pride and show of how much we've achieved in only a few short years. We have little, but we will make the utmost use of it!"

 fin_Motti_tactics:0 "Motti Tactics"

 fin_Ski_troops:0 "Ski Troops"
 fin_Ski_troops_desc:0 "During the Winter War, the Soviets were surprised to find the Finns extensively using skis to move around. This strategy proved to work well in the deep snow of Finland. Raiding parties would simply approach on skis, harass the Russians, and then speed off into the worst terrain imaginable unscathed."
 fin_improvisation:0 "Improvisation"
 fin_improvisation_desc:0 "The Finnish army and generals extensively used improvisation. Orders were rarely strict, and quick thinking on the ground was encouraged. This led to many innovative maneuvers and tricky strategies that caught the enemy off guard."
 fin_equipment_effort:0 "Molotov Cocktails"
 fin_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov declared that the Soviet Union was merely delivering food to the 'starving people of Finland' using the red air force, so the Finns developed a 'drink to go along with the bread'. Embarrassingly, a clumsy mixture of gasoline, kerosene, and some other chemicals proved to be too much for some of the Soviets' more lightly armored vehicles, setting them on fire."
 fin_equipment_effort_2:0 "The Suomi KP/-31"
 fin_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "The Suomi KP/-31 was perhaps one of the most successful submachine gun designs of World War II. It was sturdy, reliable, and accurate. Its 71-round drum magazine was even adopted by the Soviet Union for use in their firearms. Germany also purchased several thousand for use in the SS."
 fin_equipment_effort_3:0 "The KP m/44"
 fin_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The KP m/44 was a submachine gun based off of captured Soviet equipment introduced in 1944. While it was advanced and sophisticated, not many were produced before the war ended. The blueprints were taken to Spain after the war, with several being produced there."
 fin_motorization_effort:0 "Motorization Effort"
 fin_motorization_effort_desc:0 "The motorization of Finland's army was seen as necessary, but too costly. The logistical difficulties of transporting food and supplies across the vast territory of the taiga meant it was important but simultaneously unrealistic. Most of the army remained unmotorized."
 fin_armor_effort:0 "Finnish Tanks"
 fin_armor_effort_desc:0 "Finland tried some tank designs during the Winter and Continuation wars, though most of these were light designs and basically none of them were used on the battlefield due to the terrain and serious production restraints."
 fin_armor_effort_2:0 "Captured Armor"
 fin_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "I'm going to be honest: I really don't think you should do this focus."
